He was supposed to be making his rounds at the Hoede house, but for the last fifteen minutes, he’d been hovering around the south-east wall of the gardens, trying to think of something clever and romantic to say to Anya. If only Anya’s eyes were blue like the sea or green like an emerald. Instead, her eyes were brown – lovely, dreamy … melted chocolate brown? Rabbit fur brown? “Just tell her she’s got skin like moonlight,” his friend Pieter had said. “Girls love that.” A perfect solution, but the Ketterdam weather was not cooperating. There’d been no breeze off the harbour that day, and a grey milk fog had wreathed the

boy injured?” “He looks fine to me.” The captain and Hoede seemed to reach some kind of agreement. Through the glass, Joost saw Hoede enter the cell and give the boy an encouraging pat. There must have been vents in the cell because he heard Hoede say, “Be a brave lad, and there’s a few kruge in it for you.” Then he grabbed Anya’s chin with a liver-spotted hand. She tensed, and Joost’s gut tightened. Hoede gave Anya’s head a little shake. “Do as you’re told, and this will soon be over, ja?” She gave a small, tight smile. “Of course, Onkle.” Hoede whispered a few words to the guard behind Anya, then stepped out. The door shut with a loud clang, and Hoede slid a heavy lock into place. Hoede and the other merchant took positions almost directly in front of Joost and Rutger. The merchant Joost didn’t know said, “You’re sure this is wise? This girl is a Corporalnik. After what happened to your Fabrikator—” “If it was Retvenko, I’d be worried. But Anya has a sweet disposition. She’s a Healer. Not prone to aggression.” “And you’ve lowered the dose?” “Yes, but we’re agreed that if we have the same results as the Fabrikator, the Council will compensate me? I can’t be asked to bear that expense.” When the merchant nodded, Hoede signalled to the captain. “Proceed.” The same results as the Fabrikator. Retvenko claimed Yuri had vanished. Was that what he’d meant? “Sergeant,” said the captain, “are you ready?” The guard inside the cell replied, “Yes, sir.” He drew a knife. Joost swallowed hard. “First test,” said the captain. The guard bent forwards and told the boy to roll up his sleeve. The boy obeyed and stuck out his arm, popping the thumb of his other hand into his mouth. Too old for that, thought Joost. But the boy must be very scared. Joost had slept with a sock bear until he was nearly fourteen, a fact his older

[SSFOCIGO II] Frankincense is usually not in food products, yet a major portion of the food is given to the preist (V2) because all the frankincense is scraped off. Even though only a portion of food was burnt, all the frankincense was offered. Representing that the fragrance of the beauty of his life was given to the fath. John 8:29 pleasing of God was Jesus' primary goal. Though others saw his actions, the real aroma was to rise up to God.

Meaning a full knowledge, it is a key word in this letter. Personal knowledge is the beggining of Salvation, the warning in Matthew when Jesus said "I don't know you" means having no personal relationship. This knowledge does not mean surface knowledge, it is nothing that can be obtained by man - this is through the affectual calling, not the general call, which is an irrevoakable calling. Closer to a summoning.

[SSFOCIGO VI] fire is representing of the suffering of Jesus. Not only in his death, but in his life. Methods of burning:
1. On a pan (V2) 
Can see whats hapening with the naked eye. 
2. In an oven V4
The contents cannot be seen, yet at the right time one can see the right time. 
Both are representing the suffering of Christ, but we do not pay enough attention to what we cannot see. Matthew 27:27-31. This was the physical suffering which was spectated by many, this was burning in the frying pan. Matthew 27:45-46. Something terrible happened, yet we cannot understand his pain. The pain he endured before he was taken up, no body cab relate to - we cannot understand the agony of the knowledge of separation from God. This is the great burbing in the oven.

[Gleaning 17/10/20:] What was expected from Jesus was coming for judgment. Contrast to modern times, where people believe Jesus is a genie in a bottle. Jesus is not here to live up to man's expectations, but has his own purpose that is higher than what we could imagine.

[Gleaning 17/10/20:] Jesus was so much more than just talk, his very actions were a testimony of his deity. This can be cited that Jesus did not just give a simple "yes," but instead referenced events that thousands had witnessed and showed that it wasa fulfillment of scripture. Matthew specifically cites the past prophesies to show to the jews that he was the messiah, but we too can reference the thousands of - both Christian and Secular - sources that show Jesus was not a regular person.

Although the temple had a very important part in God's plan, it did not serve the purpose that these Pharisees believed it to be. They believed that God was limited to the walls of the temple, which could not have been more wrong. We often make a similar mistake in that we always limit God - either to the bible, or to church, or even just to when we are praying. Although setting aside time for God is important, it is not the only time you spend with him. 
Ensure that you always keep God in mind. 
There is one other aspect that you need to kee in mind, that you always question the "why" of the rules. This is the best preventative for legalism. That God, always in His own love, lays out commandmnts for us to abide by. Just as a father tells his son not to play near the woods is only to keep him safe. The more the son ponders on the purpose of his father's rule, the greater the child's appreciation for his father's love and his desire for his Child's safety.

This was a particular sin of the Pharisees, they always had an ulterior motive to everything they said. Jesus always knew this. It is not hard to apply this to our lives, intentions may be hard to change, but it isn't impossible. Yet the first stage is to admi to one's self. There is no need to write it down, but just ponder to the reason to each of your actions. Many pro-social behaviours are far from altruistic, yet confessing the reason you are doing it is already a step in the right direction

[TIP IV: 18/10/20] The Hypocrisy. 

This is one of the most famous attributes of the Pharisees: that they could not practise what they preach. Though showing many flaws in their system, this parricularly showed their lacl of knowledge of the pupose of the law. They were so determined of being justified by their abiding of the law, that they didn't realize it was humanly impossible. 

Another aspect which I would personally appeal to, although I am aware that I have not yet entered parenthood, is that this is a common flaw which parents fall into. Although they have the role of guiding their children, they by no means own them. Despite every rule coming from love, boil down a principle and you will find a safety measure. Acknowledging rules such as a person can't drive until their 16, is just for the safety of others. This is a conditional rules that applies for everyone. Yet som principles do not change. You don't play with knives so you don't get cut, throw stones and you will break a window, handle the kettle carelessly and you will get burned. These unconditional consequences do not factor in age, and parets too often pull the "because i told you so" card. Parents need to keep in mind that there are circumstances

[TIP VI: 18/10/20] The False Accusation. 

In this passage the desperation is so clearly shown. Not only were they incapable of keeping up to the rules which they made themselves, but the very core of their laws - the 10 commandments - did they break. 
It was in this portion which they accused of something they could not comprehend and made a bold claim that was void of any basis. This teaches us one very important lesson, that some things arebeyond our understanding and acknowledging our humanity is far from weaness. We may not have the wisdom of Solomon, but as John was a greater prophet than others, so do we have all the resources necessary resources - all we lack is passion.

Their mother was upstairs in a room bathing another child, and when she heard the cries of her son, she immediately ran downstairs. Upon seeing what had happened, she took the knife out of her son’s throat and was so enraged that she stabbed the heart of the other boy, who had been playing the butcher. Then she quickly ran back to the room to tend to her child in the bathtub, but while she had been gone, he had drowned in the tub. Now the woman became so frightened and desperate that she wouldn’t allow the neighbors to comfort her and finally hung herself. When her husband came back from the fields and saw everything, he became so despondent that he died soon thereafter.

a city named Franecker, located in West Friesland, some young boys and girls between the ages of five and six happened to be playing with one another. They chose one boy to play a butcher, another boy was to be a cook, and a third boy was to be a pig. Then they selected one girl to be a cook and another girl to be her assistant. The assistant was to catch the blood of the pig in a little bowl so they could make sausages. As agreed, the butcher now fell upon the little boy playing the pig, threw him to the ground, and slit his throat open with a knife, while the assistant cook caught the blood in her little bowl. A councilman was walking nearby and saw this wretched act. He immediately took the butcher boy with him and led him into the house of the mayor, who instantly summoned the entire council. They deliberated about this incident and didn’t know what to do with the boy, for they realized it had all been part of a children’s game. One of the councilmen, a wise old man, advised the chief judge to take a beautiful red apple in one hand and a Rhenish gold coin in the other. Then he was to call the boy and stretch out his hands to him. If the boy took the apple, he was to be set free. If he took the gold coin, he was to be killed. The judge took the wise man’s advice, and the boy grabbed the apple with a laugh. Thus he was set free without any punishment.

But she knew I was on the other side, and she threatened to turn me in to the Council. I had to silence her.” “You mean kill her,” Sophie clarified. “Why would I kill her? I needed the starstones.

. And Dad stopped moving a couple of seconds later. I tried to crawl to a phone to call the police, but then I heard them say something about searching the rest of the house, so I ducked into the nearest closet and buried myself in clothes.” Sophie shuddered as she imagined it, and her nose burned with a sweet scent, remembering the smell of the cloying drugs the Neverseen favored during their abductions. “Did you see any of their faces?” “They had their hoods up the whole time. But one of them . . .” “One of them what?” Sophie pressed. “You’re not going to believe me.” “Try us,” Keefe said. “You’d be surprised what we can believe after hanging around this one.” He elbowed Sophie gently in the ribs, and Sophie knew he was trying to break the tension. Humor was Keefe’s favorite coping mechanism. But she didn’t have the energy to joke around. Especially when her sister whispered, “One of the guys kept disappearing somehow. Like with quick flashes, fading in and out of sight.” Fitz muttered something under his breath. “That was Alvar.” “You know him?”“He’s done a lot of awful things,” Sophie jumped in, shooting Fitz a please-don’t-say-he’s-your-brother look. She doubted it would help her sister trust them. “How did he disappear like that?” her sister whispered. “It almost looked like . . .” “Magic?” Sophie guessed with a sad smile. “I remember thinking that too, the first time I saw it. But he’s what we call a Vanisher. All he’s doing is manipulating light.” “What about the mind reading thing?” her sister asked. “One of them said he was listening for nearby thoughts as he searched the house, so I thought about darkness and silence just in case.” “That was really smart,” Sophie told her, stunned she had managed to pull that off. Her sister shrugged. “I’ve seen a lot of movies. But . . . could he really do that?” “If he was a Telepath,” Fitz said. “Which means it was probably Gethen.” The name sent Sophie spiraling into nightmares of crumbling castle walls and jagged mazes of rubble. Screams echoed in her ears as the world turned red—partially with her rage, but mostly with the memory of a wound that cut too deep for her to stop the bleeding. A

The raw statistics tell the story. In the United States, for example, men between 25 and 31 are a staggering 66 percent more likely than women to be living with their parents.[1] The US prison population—which increased by more than 700 percent between 1973 and 2013—is 93 percent male and disproportionately young.[2] Every day, 150 workers die from hazardous working conditions, and 92 percent of them are male.[3] By the eighth grade, 41 percent of girls are at least proficient in writing, while only 20 percent of boys are.[4] Elsewhere, a large study from Britain finds that boys’ IQs have dropped by about 15 percent since the 1980s.[5] In their important book The Boy Crisis, Warren Farrell and John Gray present us with a confronting diagnosis. They write: “the most important single crisis in developed countries [is] dad-deprived children, and especially dad-deprived boys”.[6] An astonishing 85 percent of US youths in prison grew up in fatherless homes;[7] 90 percent of US male prisoners are father-deprived, as are 85 percent of mass shooters.

Even when boys do manage a decent level of educational attainment, they are often less likely to obtain a job and likely to earn less than their female counterparts. In 147 of America’s biggest cities, women in their twenties are not only more likely than men of the same age to find a job as the emerging employment market favours women; they are also earning more than men of the same age.[8] In Australian society, young men are under-represented in Australian university enrolments, with females accounting for 58 percent of all students in 2016.[9] The proportion of female postgraduates is even higher. Sadly, men are significantly over-represented in the suicide rate. In 2017, 2,348 Australian men took their own lives.[10] This figure was up a massive 10 percent on 2016 and is three times the female suicide rate.[11] Men are also dramatically over-represented in the Australian prison population: Corrective Services Australia reported in 2021 that 92 percent of the prison population was male (39,768 inmates).[12]
